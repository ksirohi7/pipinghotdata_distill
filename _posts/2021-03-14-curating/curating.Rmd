# TL; DR

# Signing up

R-Ladies has a [comprehensive guide](https://guide.rladies.org/rocur/about/){target="_blank"} describing why the program exists, procedures and protocols for the week, and 
tips for successful curation. You sign up by [submitting a form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSevtboT8TNjz87qe5HZzuBHuY0aNteaZNF5e2xFQXtSeU0c0w/viewform){target="_blank"} - give yourself at least 30 minutes to sign up as part of the
form includes filling out details that complete your [curating profile](https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies/status/1361139211819180032){target="_blank"}.

# Picking a date

You can view the [schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pmphnR9EinGuAKbVqGzMIt6cWYmHNbeFVzaKJB59JdY/edit#gid=1429703967){target="_blank"} of previous and upcoming curators to identify available dates.  

Being a curator will be time intensive, so be kind to yourself. Choose dates when you will have time to invest and a flexible work schedule. I chose Feb 15-20 
because I hoped by then I should be recovered from a very intense Q4 work cycle;
additionally, Feb 15 (President's Day) was a company holiday.

An additional consideration is to schedule your curation to coincide with dates that align with your interests. For example, are you passionate about Black History Month in February, LGBT Pride Month in June, or Universal Human Rights Month in December? 
If so, take advantage of the `@WeAreRLadies` large platform as an opportunity to inform and educate others on issues that are important to you as they relate to the 
R community.

# Countdown

# Content inspiration

As I approached my curating week, I recalled previous `@WeAreRLadies` that were
memorable for me, as well as drew on my previous experience as an educator.
