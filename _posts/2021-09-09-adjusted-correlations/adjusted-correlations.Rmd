# TL;DR

Correlations are a common analytic technique to identify associations between numeric variables; however, estimates can be misleading when underlying groups or related observations are present. Adjusted correlation estimates can be obtained through a linear mixed model that yield sensible estimates of overall correlations across subgroups.

# Overview

In various settings, correlations can be mass estimated to identify signals as to which of 
many independent variables have the strongest association with a dependent 
variable. Moreover, the correlations are commonly estimated in aggregate, or total,
across may subgroups. Example applications include: 

* market research, when evaluating associations between product ratings and product sales across many products, in order to identify attributes with the strongest
relationship with sales across all products.

* biological research, when evaluating associations between gene mRNA expressions across many cancer types.

unnest(c(data, results)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(label = glue::glue("Feature {feature}\n r = {scales::number(correlation)}"))
```

Correlations (_r_) take on values between -1 and 1, and measure the strength of the linear association between two numeric variables. Here are the three extreme forms of correlation:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dat_all %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(color = "#E76F51", alpha = 0.7) +
  facet_wrap(. ~ label) +
  theme_shannon()
```

A value of `0` indicates no linear association, whereas values of `-1` or `1` indicate a perfect linear association. The two main conditions that need to be satisfied for good correlation estimates are:

1. The relationship is linear.

2. The observations are independent.

The linearity of the relationship can be evaluated by examining a scatter plot. Independence of observations is evaluated by thinking about the origin and nature of the data. A classic way of violating the independence assumption is when observations arise from repeated measures; a less obvious way the independence observation can be violated is from what Isabella  Ghement refers to as a [random grouping factor](https://twitter.com/IsabellaGhement/status/1443773295426359298){target="_blank"}. 

Let's check this out by examining correlations from a Simpson's paradox example. `r emo::ji("monocle")`


# Simpson's paradox: a Palmer penguins example

The Palmer penguins data set comes from the [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/){target="_blank"} package.
Andrew Heiss recently [tweeted](https://twitter.com/andrewheiss/status/1443570972703936523?s=20){target="_blank"} a quick demonstration of a [Simpson's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox){target="_blank"} for this
data, where the relationship between `bill_depth_mm` and `body_mass_g` can appear 
differently when analyzed across all species of penguins versus within species.

For initial data preparation, I am retaining the relevant variables, removing
missing observations, and creating a duplicate of the `species` variable for point
colors and faceting later.

```{r}
dat_penguins <- penguins %>% 
  dplyr::select(species, bill_depth_mm, body_mass_g) %>% 
  # duplicate species variable for coloring & grouping ---
  mutate(species_category = species) %>% 
  drop_na()
```

```{r}
# species colors used in the palmerpenguins readme ----
colors_penguins <- c(
  "Adelie" = "darkorange",
  "Chinstrap" = "purple",
  "Gentoo" = "cyan4"
  )
```

Let's examine the correlations between `bill_depth_mm` and `body_mass_g` for the three penguin species individually, as well as across all species.

```{r}
dat_penguins %>% 
  # add stack for all species to be analyzed together ----
  bind_rows(dat_penguins %>% mutate(species_category = "All")) %>% 
  # now examine by 3 species plus all ----
  group_by(species_category) %>% 
  nest() %>% 
  # within each group, compute base n and correlation ----
  mutate(
    base_n = map_int(data, nrow),
    corr = map(data, ~ cor.test(x = .x$bill_depth_mm, y = .x$body_mass_g) %>% broom::tidy())
    ) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  # bring results back to raw data ----
  unnest(c(data, corr)) %>% 
  mutate(
    # create ordered facet label for plotting ----
    species_category = fct_relevel(species_category, "Gentoo", "Chinstrap", "Adelie", "All"),
    corr_label =  glue::glue("{species_category}\nn = {base_n}\n r = {scales::number(estimate, 0.01)}"),
    corr_label = fct_reorder(as.character(corr_label), as.numeric(species_category))
   ) %>% 
  # create scatter plots ----
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = species), alpha = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE) +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "darkgray", se = FALSE) +
    facet_wrap(. ~ corr_label, ncol = 4) +
    scale_color_manual(values = colors_penguins) + 
    theme_shannon()
```

Here we see that within species the correlations between `bill_depth_mm` and `body_mass_g`
are `0.72`, `0.60`, and `0.58`. Yet when we look at the correlation across all species,
we have a nonsensical estimate of `-0.47` `r emo::ji("scream")`, which is a classical presentation of
Simpson's paradox. 

Getting a reasonable estimate of the correlation between `bill_depth_mm` and `body_mass_g` 
across all three species requires a bit more work. To estimate a correlation that adjusts for species, we can implement a [linear mixed model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilevel_model){target="_blank"}, also frequently referred to as a multilevel model, which "allow us to create models for situations where the observations are not independent of one another" as stated in [Beyond Multiple Linear Regression: Applied Generalized Linear Models and Multilevel Models in R](https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-BeyondMLR/ch-MLRreview.html#learning-objectives) by Paul Roback and Julie Leger. 

In this approach, we model the dependent variable of `body_mass_g` with a fixed effect for `bill_depth_mm` (what we want to draw inferences about) and a random effect for `species` (which can be thought of as a sample from a larger population of species that we are not interested in drawing specific inferences about). The correlation estimate adjusting for `species` group membership is the sign of the `bill_depth_mm` coefficient multiplied by the square root of the variance explained at the different `species` levels. Here, I use the [`r2_nakagawa`](https://easystats.github.io/performance/reference/r2_nakagawa.html){target="_blank"} function from the `performance` package to extract the relevant $R^2$ value.


```{r}
# estimate mixed model ----
mixed_model <- lme4::lmer(body_mass_g ~ bill_depth_mm + (1 | species), dat_penguins)

# retrieve sign of coefficient ----
coef_sign <- mixed_model %>% 
  broom.mixed::tidy() %>% 
  filter(term == "bill_depth_mm") %>% 
  pull(estimate) %>% 
  sign()

# retrieve r2 measure ----
r2_by_group <- performance::r2_nakagawa(mixed_model, by_group = TRUE)$R2[1]

# compute adjusted correlation ----
adj_corr <- coef_sign * sqrt(r2_by_group)

# print result ----
adj_corr
```

Ah, much better! `r emo::ji("star-struck")` A correlation estimate between `bill_depth_mm` and `body_mass_g` of `0.62` across all three penguins species is a much more sensible estimate.

# Multiple features: spotify songs example

## Data

The data comes from the [TidyTuesday Spotify songs](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-01-21/readme.md){target="_blank"} data set.

```{r}
# import data ----
dat_raw <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-01-21/spotify_songs.csv')
```


To reduce the scope and simplify, I am going to examine a reduced set of variables from `pop`, `rock`,
or `rap` songs in 2019. Our goal is to understand which of `energy`, `speechiness`, `acousticness`, `instrumentalness`, `liveness`, and `valence` have the strongest association with `danceability`.

```{r}
# initial data prep ----
dat <- dat_raw %>% 
  mutate(year = str_sub(track_album_release_date, start = 1, end = 4) %>% as.numeric) %>% 
  filter(playlist_genre %in% c("pop", "rock", "rap")) %>%
  filter(year == 2019) %>% 
  dplyr::select(track_id, playlist_genre, danceability, energy, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence) %>% 
  # create an additional variable for genre to be used later ----
  mutate(music_category = playlist_genre) 
```

```{r}
dat
```

Here are the definitions of the variables, straight from the TidyTuesday repo:

|variable                 |class     |description |
|:---|:---|:-----------|
|track_id                 |character | Song unique ID|
|playlist_genre           |character | Playlist genre |
|danceability             |double    | Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable. |
|energy                   |double    | Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy. |
|speechiness              |double    | Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks. |
|acousticness             |double    | A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.|
|instrumentalness         |double    | Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0. |
|liveness                 |double    | Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live. |
|valence                  |double    | A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry). |


```{r}
# create stacked data for analysis ----
dat_stacked <- dat %>% 
  # add in all level for across all genres ----
  bind_rows(dat %>% mutate(music_category = "all")) %>% 
  dplyr::select(track_id, music_category, playlist_genre, danceability, energy, 
                speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence) %>% 
  # convert to long format for plotting and analysis ----
  pivot_longer(
    -c(track_id, music_category, playlist_genre, danceability),
    names_to = "feature",
    values_to = "value"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    music_category = fct_relevel(music_category, "pop", "rock", "rap", "all"),
    # reordered by a sneak peak at results below ----
    feature = fct_relevel(feature, "valence", "speechiness", "energy", "acousticness", "liveness", "instrumentalness")
  )
```

## Visual exploration

Let's start with a visual exploration of the data.

```{r}
# colors for playlist genre ----
colors_genre <- c(
  "pop" = "#E76F51",
  "rock" = "#264653",
  "rap" = "#E9C46A"
)

```


```{r}
dat_stacked %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = value, y = danceability)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = playlist_genre), alpha = 0.2, show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_grid(feature ~ music_category, scales = "free") +
  scale_color_manual(values = colors_genre) +
  theme_shannon()
```
Visual inspection shows the possibility of some non-linear relationships, for example, with `energy`, and also some potential outliers that could influence the correlation estimate. However, for this analysis we will proceed with data as-is. In addition, note that `pop` and `rock` tend
to have similar distributions, which differ from `rap`.


## Correlation computations

First, we compute correlations for the three genres individually and  the unadjusted correlations across all genres together.

```{r}
results_1 <- dat_stacked %>%
  group_by(music_category, feature) %>% 
  nest() %>% 
  mutate(
    corr = map(data, ~ cor.test(x = .x$value, y = .x$danceability) %>% broom::tidy())
    ) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  unnest(c(corr)) %>% 
  dplyr::select(music_category, feature, corr = estimate)
```

Next, we compute the adjusted correlations across all genres together through the linear mixed model. To facilitate this computation, here is a quick function.

```{r}
compute_adj_corr <- function(data, var_dep, var_ind, var_group){
  
  mixed_formula <- glue::glue("{var_dep} ~ {var_ind} + (1 | {var_group})")
  
  mixed_model <- lme4::lmer(mixed_formula, data)

  coef_sign <- mixed_model %>% 
    broom.mixed::tidy() %>% 
    filter(term == var_ind) %>% 
    pull(estimate) %>% 
    sign()

 r2_by_group <- performance::r2_nakagawa(mixed_model, by_group = TRUE)$R2[1]

 adj_corr <- coef_sign * sqrt(r2_by_group)

 return(adj_corr)
}
```

Now we compute the adjusted correlations.

```{r}
results_2 <- dat_stacked %>%
  filter(music_category == "all") %>%
  group_by(feature) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(
    corr = map_dbl(
      data,
      compute_adj_corr,
      var_dep = "danceability",
      var_ind = "value",
      var_group = "playlist_genre"
    )
  ) %>%
  mutate(music_category = "adjusted") %>%
  dplyr::select(music_category, feature, corr)
```

Finally, we combine both sets of results into a single data set for presentation.

```{r}
results_all <- results_1 %>% 
  bind_rows(results_2) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "music_category",
    values_from = "corr"
    ) %>% 
  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 2) %>% 
  arrange(desc(adjusted)) %>% 
  rename(unadjusted = all)
```

## Results

```{r}
results_all %>% 
  gt::gt() %>% 
  gt::tab_header(
    title = "Correlations with danceability"
  ) %>% 
  gt::tab_spanner(
    label = "Genres",
    columns = c(pop, rap, rock)
  ) %>%
  gt::tab_spanner(
    label = "All",
    columns = c(unadjusted, adjusted)
  ) %>%
  gt::cols_align(
    align = "left",
    columns = feature
  ) %>% 
  gtExtras::gt_hulk_col_numeric(pop:adjusted)
```

Here, we see that `valence` has the strongest association with `danceability`, 
both within each of the genres and across the three genres. Regarding `valence`,
both the unadjusted and adjusted correlation estimates are similar. However,
for other attributes, such as `speechiness`, the association varies by genre (weakly positive 
for `rap`, weakly negative for `rock`). Furthermore, the unadjusted (`0.25`) and 
adjusted (`0.09`) correlations differ by quite a bit, with the unadjusted correlation
once again producing a nonsensical result that exceeds the correlations for any
individual genre (`-0.11` rock, `0.06` pop, and `0.13` rap).


# Discussion

Correlations are used by researchers of all backgrounds and expertise due to their
relatively straightforward computation and interpretation. When the
distributions of dependent and independent variables are similar across subgroups,
the unadjusted simple correlation estimates are likely to be similar to the more
complex adjusted correlation estimates; however, when distributions vary by subgroups, 
simple correlation estimates across subgroups could be incorrect and misleading.
A primary defense to guard against this is to plot your data - this can help you to identify
grouping effects or when relationships are non-linear. In addition, it should be
carefully considered if the relationships across groups are truly of more interest
than relationships within groups, as across group results can obscure potentially
interesting within group findings.
