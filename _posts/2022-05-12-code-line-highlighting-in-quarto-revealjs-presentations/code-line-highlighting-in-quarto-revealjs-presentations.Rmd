# TL; DR

I started playing with Quarto revealjs presentations, it is fun! Here are three methods
I learned to highlight code lines.

# Terminology

Some terminology introduced in the Quarto documentation includes:

* executable / compute vs non-executable / non-compute

  + This differentiates code that computes or executes versus code that does not (display only code).

* code chunk vs code block

  + Generally, it seems code chunk is more consistent with executable / compute code, whereas as
  code block more typically refers to display only code.

* code cells / cell option

  + I think this Quarto specific lingo for code chunks and options within code chunks. In 
  Quarto, you can use some of the existing chunk options from RMarkdown, as well
  as new Quarto specific options.
  
  + From the documentation,  "Cell options affect the execution and output of executable code blocks."
  
For more information on displaying code, see:

`Quarto -> Guide -> Tools -> Visual Editor -> Technical Writing -> Displaying code`

<https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/technical.html#displaying-code>

For a complete overview of all code block options supported in Quarto, see

`Quarto -> Reference -> Code Cells -> Knitr`.

<https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-knitr.html#code-output>



# `code-line-numbers`

To highlight code lines in Quarto revealjs presentations, use the option `code-line-numbers`.
This is a Quarto specific cell option for Quarto presentation formats of `revealjs`. 
This means that `code-line-numbers` will not render code
highlighting when used in Quarto documents (`.qmd`) of format `html`, nor within
an R markdown document (`.Rmd`). Note that Quarto cell options have a dash their name. 

I first found this option in presentation revealjs documentation:

`Quarto -> Guide -> Formats -> Presentations -> Revealjs -> Code Blocks`.

<https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/#code-blocks>

# Method 1: 

````{verbatim}
```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: FALSE
#| code-line-numbers: "1"
x <- 1:10
x
LETTERS[x]
```
````

Here, we are executing code cell options via special comments indicated by `#|`. 
Comment-based syntax is recommended for Quarto to make documents more portable and 
consistent across execution engines. See 

`Quarto -> Guide -> Computations -> Using R -> Chunk Options`.

<https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html#chunk-options>

# Method 2:

````{verbatim}
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, `code-line-numbers`="2"}
x <- 1:10
x
LETTERS[x]
```
````

Quarto code cell options have dash in their name; R only supports dashes in variable 
names when wrapped in the back tick.


# Method 3: 

````{verbatim}
```{.r code-line-numbers="3"}
x <- 1:10
x
LETTERS[x]
```
````

`.r` signals a non-compute code block (which is what we used above with `eval=FALSE`). 
These are verbatim code blocks with a class set on them for language highlighting. 
In this case, the language is R.

# Summary

There is a lot of wonderful Quarto documentation, but navigating it all takes practice and time.
I am new to Quarto, so suggestions and corrections to this post are most welcome.


For a quick starter on this topic, you can download the full Quarto revealjs presentation demonstration 
`r xfun::embed_file(here::here("_posts", "2022-05-12-code-line-highlighting-in-quarto-revealjs-presentations", "demo", "quarto-code-hl.qmd"), text = "quarto-code-hl.qmd")`.

And here are the rendered presentation slides, which you can click through.


```{r embed-xaringan, echo=FALSE}
xaringanExtra::embed_xaringan(url = "demo/quarto-code-hl.html", ratio = "4:3")
```
