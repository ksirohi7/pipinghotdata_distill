```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, dpi=1)
```

```{r thumbnail, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
#| fig.cap: > 
#|   Left hand side shows `.qmd` source code; right hand side shows rendered slides
#|   with line highlighting.
#| fig.alt: > 
#|    `.qmd` source code shows three different methods for code highlighting;
#|    on right hand side, image of slide 1 shows line 1 highlighted, 
#|    image of slide 2 shows line 2 highlighted, and image of slide 3 shows
#|    line 3 highlighted.

````{verbatim}
We can output arbitrary content verbatim.

```{r}
1 + 1
```

The content can contain inline code like
`r pi * 5^2`, too.

# TL; DR

I started playing with Quarto revealjs presentations, it is fun! Here are some methods
I learned to highlight code lines.

# Overview

In general, `code-line-numbers` is a Quarto specific code cell option for presentation 
formats of `revealjs`. This means that `code-line-numbers` will not render code
highlighting when used in Quarto documents (`.qmd`) of format `html`, nor within
an R markdown document (`.Rmd`). Note that Quarto chunk options have a dash their name.

For a complete overview of all code cell options supported in Quarto, see
`Quarto -> Reference -> Code Cells -> Knitr`
<https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-knitr.html#code-output>


```{embed, file="demo/quarto-code-hl.qmd"}
```

# Method 1: 

````{verbatim}

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: FALSE
#| code-line-numbers: "1"
x <- 1:10
x
LETTERS[x]
```

````

Here, we are executing code cell options via special comments indicated by `#|`. 
Comment-based syntax is recommended for Quarto to make documents more portable and 
consistent across execution engines. See 
`Quarto -> Guide -> Computations -> Using R -> Chunk Options`

<https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html#chunk-options>

# Method 2:

Quarto cell options have dash in their name; R only supports dashes in variable 
names when wrapped in the back tick.


# Method 3: 

`.r` signals a non-compute code cell (which is what we used above with `eval=FALSE`). 
These are verbatim code chunks with a class set on them for language highlighting. 
In this case, the language is R.
(Is there a reference for this?)
