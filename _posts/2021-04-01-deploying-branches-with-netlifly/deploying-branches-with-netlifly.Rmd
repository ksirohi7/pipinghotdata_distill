# TL; DR

# Netlifly settings

First, make sure you have deploy previews enabled on Netlifly. Go to your site, and then:

`r emo::ji("right arrow")` Site settings

`r emo::ji("right arrow")` Build & deploy

`r emo::ji("right arrow")` Deploy contexts 

`r emo::ji("right arrow")` Deploy previews 

`r emo::ji("right arrow")` Select **Any pull request against your production branch / branch deploy branches** _Netlify will generate a deploy preview with a unique URL for each built pull request._

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Screenshot of Netlifly settings with Deploy previews set to "Any pull request...".'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/netlifly-settings.png")
```

# Back in R

1. Create a branch for your repo/website:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
usethis::pr_init("netlifly-deploy-branch")
```

2. Create a post:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
distill::create_post("Deploy previews with Netlifly")
```

3. Draft post; set `draft: false` in the `yaml`.

4.
