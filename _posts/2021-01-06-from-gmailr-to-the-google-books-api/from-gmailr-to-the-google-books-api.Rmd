# TL; DR

# Background

I live in Doylestown, PA, which is within Bucks County. On March 14, 2020, the Bucks County library system closed due to COVID-19. On June 22, 2020, the library opened for curbside pick-up. The library allows up to 15 holds at a time, and when a hold arrives, I receive 
an email notice like this:

Email notifications are generally sent around midnight, collating any books that 
arrived that day. I removed my home address and cell phone number from this screen shot and from the data for this post.

# Getting started

```{r}
library(gmailr)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(httr)
library(gt)
```


# Retrieving email notifications with gmailr

I followed the [`gmailr` set up instructions](https://gmailr.r-lib.org/index.html#setup){target="_blank"} to authenticate myself and enable R's `gmailr`
package to interact with the Gmail API for my personal Gmail account, which was 
fairly straightforward. This required some point and click in other interfaces, 
followed by two lines of R code.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
gm_auth_configure(path = "path/credentials.json")
gm_auth()
```

Once authenticated, I retrieved the email notifications from my gmail account. It was not 
immediately clear to me how to do this, but this [stack overflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62420703/extracting-all-emails-using-gmailr){target="_blank"} helped.  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# 1 - retrieve messages corresponding to this search ----
messages <- gmailr::gm_messages("Bucks County Library System - Available Hold Pickup Notice")

# 2 - extract ids from messages corresponding to search ----
message_ids <- gmailr::gm_id(messages)

# 3 - extract contents from messages with these ids -----
message_full <- purrr::map(message_ids, gmailr::gm_message)

# 4 - extract message body from contents -----
message_body <- purrr::map(message_full, gmailr::gm_body)
```

This resulted in 67 email notifications from June 22, 2020 to December 30, 3020, containing from 1 to 11 books per email. Here is an example character string returned to me, corresponding to the email notification shown above.

```{r}
message_body[[66]]
```


# Parsing the email body

I then did my best to convert the date of the email notification, the book title, and book author to a tibble. This was a three step iterative process.

First, I created a list with the dates of the 67 emails. 

```{r}
# 1 - extract date of email notification ----
message_date <- purrr::map(
  message_body, 
    # start string at first character, end where 2020 ends ----
    ~ stringr::str_sub(.x , start = 1, end = str_locate(.x, "2020") %>% .[2]) %>% 
    # convert text string to date ----
    lubridate::mdy(.)
    )
```

```{r}
# view last 6 entries ----
tail(message_date)
```

Second, I did some initial cleaning to remove the introductory text, and then 
split the strings to one rows per book entry. 

```{r}
message_books <- purrr::map(
  message_body,  
    # remove formatting text, affect other stringr code ----
    ~ str_remove_all(.x, "[\\r|\\n]") %>% 
    # remove all introductory text ----
    str_remove(".* listed above.  ") %>%
    # split string when any digit is identified ----
    str_split("[[:digit:]]   ")
)
```

```{r}
# view last 6 entries ----
tail(message_books)
```

Third, I converted this to a tibble, removed all non-book rows, and iterated with 
stringr functions to get the title and author as best as I could. This was challenging
as not all entries had consitent formatting, and some adjustments I could make here
improved the Google Books API search below.

```{r}
# split author and books into separate variables ----
books <- message_books %>% 
  # coerce list to tibble ----
  tibble() %>% 
  # rename first column ----
  rename("text" = 1) %>% 
  # unnest list text field ----
  unnest(cols = "text") %>%
  # merge in notice date ----
  mutate(notice_date = message_date %>% unlist() %>% as_date()) %>% 
  # unnest one more time ----
  unnest(cols = "text") %>% 
  # remove strings starting with spaces, these are not books ----
  filter(!str_sub(text, 1, 1) %in% c(" ", "")) %>% 
  # a lot of iteration here to extract author/title ----
  # sort by notice date before assigning id ----
  arrange(notice_date) %>% 
  mutate(
    # create id ----
    id = row_number(),
    # clean title until looks ok ----
    title = str_remove(text, " /.*") %>% 
      str_remove("Wells.*") %>%
      str_remove(" \\[.*") %>% 
      str_remove(": from.*") %>% 
      str_remove("\\*") %>%
      str_remove("Nino") %>% # affected api search ----
      str_remove("American [Gg]irl.") %>% # affected api search ----
      str_trim(),
    # clean author until looks ok ----
    author = str_remove(text, ".* /") %>% 
      str_remove("Sendak, Maurice") %>% 
      str_remove(" ; .*") %>% 
      str_remove("\\[") %>% 
      str_remove("\\]") %>% 
      str_remove(".* by ") %>%
      str_remove(".*! ") %>% 
      str_remove("and .*") %>%
      # remove everything after a period, but affected authors with first or middle initial ----
      str_remove("\\..*") %>% 
      str_remove("\\*") %>% 
      str_remove_all("& Sue .*| an |book") %>% 
      str_squish()
  ) %>% 
  # remove non pre-k books ----
  dplyr::filter(!(title %in% c("Pax", "Luster", "Last night in Montreal : a novel"))) %>% 
  # count number of books per emails ----
  group_by(notice_date) %>% 
  add_count() %>% 
  ungroup()
```

```{r}
# view first 6 entries, as now sorted by notice date ----
head(books)
```
