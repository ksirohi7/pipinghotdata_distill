# TL; DR

Customizing tables in PDF output is possible with [`{knitr}`](https://yihui.org/knitr/){target="_blank"} , [`{kableExtra}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_pdf.pdf){target="_blank"} and a
bit of LaTeX. Recent updates available in [`{gtsummary}`](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/){target="_blank"} 
1.5.1 also allow users to more easily take advantage of these features in summary tables.

# Background

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Can anyone point me to a good R package that can create tables that are easily outputted in PDF. So far every package I have found seems to require numerous external packages and plug-ins in order to output the table as a PDF document. Any advice welcome.</p>&mdash; Charlie Harper (@charlieharperuk) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieharperuk/status/1484149123372793859?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

You and me both, Charlie.  This is tricky. I tried to avoid the LaTeX route through
[`{pagedown}`](https://pagedown.rbind.io/){target="_blank"} , but ultimately because I had many tables that varied in size and length, 
this was not a quick approach.

Here is a solution have landed upon; I hope it helps you and others as well. 
If anyone has additional tips or approaches, please share in the comments!
