# TL; DR

This blog post accompanies the [R-Ladies Philly](https://www.rladiesphilly.org/) workshop on November 12, 2020.  
Central idea: leverage [devtools](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools) and [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) in package development!

Will update with link to YouTube workshop recording when available.

# Abstract

This workshop is for people looking to learn how to make their own R packages and learn how to use “usethis” and “devtools” for package development. The workshop will cover handy one time functions (i.e., `use_this::create_package`) as well as functions used continuously throughout package development (i.e., `devtools::document`). At the end of the hour you should have a working, well-documented package with a single function, as well as a better understanding of the files and file structure required for R packages.

This workshop is suitable for beginner to intermediate R users. Attendees should be familiar with functions, but will not be writing their own function in this workshop. Familiarity with pipe or tidyverse is helpful.

# Getting started

This material was developed using:

| Software / package  | Version               |
|---------------------|-----------------------|
| R                   | 4.0.2                 | 
| RStudio             | 1.3.1073              | 
| `devtools`          | 2.3.2                 | 
| `usethis`           | 1.6.3                 |
| `tidyverse`         | 1.3.0                 |
| `broom`             | 0.7.1

Please update all software / packages prior to following along with this tutorial, as otherwise errors may arise.

# Toolkit

Single usage functions only need to be used one time in the development process;
multiple usage functions are executed as needed.

::: l-body-outset
| Usage    | Function   | Purpose               |
|----------|------------|-----------------------|
| Single   | `usethis::create_package("path/packagename")`  | initialize package   | 
|          | `usethis::use_mit_license("Your name")`        | adds license         |
|          | `usethis::use_pipe()`                          | add pipe function as a dependency |
| Multiple | `devtools::load_all()`           | simulates package installation |
|          | `devtools::check()`           | build locally and check package |
|          | `devtools::build()`           | builds package |
|          | `usethis::use_r("file-name")` | create R script for function |
|          | `usethis::use_package("package-name")` | add package dependency |
|          | `devtools::document()` | document a function |

# First package

Open an R session and submit the following, modified to your desired location.  Here,
I am creating a package named `ralph` on my desktop. (This name is inspired by **R**-**L**adies **Ph**illy.) 

```{r create-package, eval=FALSE}
usethis::create_package("C:/Users/Shannon.Pileggi/Desktop/ralph")
```

_insert gif_

Now you have a package!  The `usethis::create_package` function:

1. Creates a new R project at your specified location named `ralph`.

2. Opens your `ralph` project in a new RStudio session.

3. Creates the minimal essential files and structure required for R packages.

_in workshop: discuss files, not to include write up in post here?? or include??_

# First check

Now that we have a package, let's check it.  Submitting `devtools::check()` updates package documentation and builds the package. 

```{r check-package-1, eval=FALSE}
devtools::check()
```

This can take a while to run, depending on how big your package is.  It
is really helpful to run *frequently*, especially if you are planning
on submitting to CRAN.  But even for internal packages, it is still
good practice.  

_insert gif or screenshot_

Our first check results in a single warning - that our package needs a license.  You can see this in the description file:

_insert screenshot_

To fix this, add the [license](https://r-pkgs.org/description.html#description-license) of your choice.  A standard go-to recommendation is the MIT license.  

```{r use-license, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_mit_license("Your name")
```

This updates the description file, as well as creates two new license files in your project that you never have to touch.

_insert screenshot_

You can go back and complete the remaining [description](https://r-pkgs.org/description.html#description-license) fields later.  For now, re-submit 

```{r check-package-2, eval=FALSE}
devtools::check()
```

and now our package is error, warning, and note free.

_insert screenshot_

# First function

### Create

```{r define-function, eval = TRUE}
compute_corr <- function(data, xvar, yvar){
  
  cor.test(x = data[[xvar]], y = data[[yvar]]) %>% 
    # tidy up results ----
    broom::tidy() %>% 
    # retain and rename relevant bits ----
    dplyr::select(
      correlation = estimate, 
      pval = p.value
    )
  
}
```

The `compute_corr` function is a wrapper for `cor.test` to produce tidy output for Pearson's correlation estimate (along with a p-value) to quantify the linear relationship between two quantitative variables. Let's add the `compute_corr` function to `ralph`.

```{r create-function, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_r("compute_corr")
```

This creates a blank R script named `compute_corr.R` located in `R/` folder.  It is convention that your function name and R script name are the *same*.

Copy and paste the function to the blank R script.

_insert screenshot_

Voila!

### Execute

Take your function for a [test drive](https://r-pkgs.org/workflows101.html#load-all) with `devtool::load_all` ("arguably the most important part of the devtools workflow").

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::load_all()
```

This places your function in local memory so that you may tinker and confirm its 
execution.  Let's give it a try.

```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
compute_corr(mpg, "cty", "hwy")
```

Now we have confirmed our function is working as intended.

### Document

Next [document](https://r-pkgs.org/man.html) the `compute_corr` function using the Roxygen skeleton. You can add this two ways:

1. `Code -> Insert Roxygen Skeleton`, or 

2. `Cntrl + Alt + Shift + R`

Now you should see this:

_insert image_

where we now have a skeleton to fill in.  Note that the three arguments
in our function (`data`, `xvar`, `yvar`) were automatically detected.  Update the documentation as follows:


```{r, eval = FALSE}
#' Computes a tidy correlation
#'
#' @param data input data set
#' @param xvar a quoted character string for the x-variable
#' @param yvar a quoted character string for the y-variable
#'
#' @return A tibble with the Pearson correlation and the p-value
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
#' compute_corr(data = mtcars, xvar = "hp", yvar = "mpg")
```


_insert screenshot_

Now submit

```{r document-function, eval = FALSE}
devtools::document()
```

This did a LOT of work for you!

_insert screenshot_

1. The `man` folder (short for `manual`) has been created in your package.

2. The `man` folder now contains a file called `compute_corr.Rd`.  This is the documentation for your function; you *never* edit this manually.

3. Your `NAMESPACE` also now says that we have a function in your package to export. 

We can preview the documentation with:

```{r preview-documentation, eval = FALSE}
?compute_corr
```

_insert screenshot_

If you want to modify your documentation, make the changes in the Roxygen skeleton in `compute_corr.R` and then resubmit `devtools::document()`.


### Check

Now submit 

```{r check-package-3, eval=FALSE}
devtools::check()
```

and you'll see that we have some concerns.

_insert screenshot_

This is because our `compute_corr` depends on functions from other packages, such as:

1. The pipe function ` %>%` from the `magrittr` package.

2. The `tidy` function from the `broom` package.

3. The `select` function from the `dplyr` package.

### Dependencies

We can fix these errors by specifying the [dependencies](https://r-pkgs.org/description.html#dependencies) in the `compute_corr` function.  

**1. Package dependencies**

To specify a _package_ dependency, the name of the package needs to be listed in the `DESCRIPTION` file.  This can be automatically done for you by submitting

```{r, eval = F}
usethis::use_package("broom")
usethis::use_package("dplyr")
```
 

_insert screenshot_

**2. Functions within packages**

There are three ways you can specify functions within packages as a dependency.  

1. Use the `::` notation within your function, as in `broom::tidy`.

2. In the Roxygen section of your function, use `@importFrom pkg fun1 fun2` - if you prefer this over using `::`.

3. In the Roxygen section of your function, `@import pkg` - imports all functions from a package; use sparingly/wisely as this may make your package bulkier.

**Special case** The pipe (`%>%`) is a special case. This is a function from the `magrittr` package.  The easiest way to include the pipe is

```{r, eval = F}
usethis::use_pipe()  # step 1 ----
devtools::document() # step 2 ----
```

Here, step 1 creates `utils-pipe.R` in your `R` folder, and step 2 adds the pipe to your `NAMESPACE` file.

_insert screenshot_

Now let's run the check again:

```{r, eval = F}
devtools::check()
```

Can you diagnose the note this time? What steps would you take to correct it?  I'm saving this for discussion in the 
workshop.^[We missed specifying an additional package dependency in the `compute_corr` function - that the `cor.test` function is from the `stats` package. 
Update the `compute_corr` function with `stats::cor.test`, and then `devtools::check()` again.]

# Installing your package

Open a new R session.  Install your package from your local directory, load your
package, and execute your functions. 

```{r, eval = F}
# install package ----
devtools::install("C:/Users/Shannon.Pileggi/Desktop/ralph")

# load package ----
library(ralph)
```


```{r, eval = TRUE}
# test function ----
compute_corr(data = mtcars, xvar = "hp", yvar = "mpg")
```


# Summary 

I hope you feel empowered to start developing your own packages now! We went 
through many of these steps one time only; however, in the development process,
many of these step are iterative and need to be repeated. Here is a re-cap of our steps, although
your work flow may differ. Starred steps should be done often.
