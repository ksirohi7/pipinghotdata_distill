### Overview

A poster presentation for the 2021 virtual Women in Statistics and Data Science conference.

### Abstract

The `@WomenInStat` (Women in Statistics and Data Science) and `@WeAreRLadies` (We are R-Ladies) rotating Twitter curator accounts promote visibility of women in our field and facilitates engagement with others. Serving as a rotating curator on a Twitter account with thousands of followers may seem daunting, but it is a great opportunity to share your knowledge, connect with others with similar interests, and learn something in return. In this talk, Iâ€™ll discuss how I planned ahead for my `@WeAreRLadies` curation week, what happened the week of, and the good things that followed.
